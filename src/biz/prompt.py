## Output Format

```

Please strictly use the prefixes 'Thought: ' and 'Action: '.

## Action Space
The available actions in the action space are as follows:
- click(start_box='[x1, y1, x2, y2]')
- left_double(start_box='[x1, y1, x2, y2]')
- right_single(start_box='[x1, y1, x2, y2]')
- drag(start_box='[x1, y1, x2, y2]', end_box='[x3, y3, x4, y4]')
- hotkey(key='')
- type(content='') #If you want to submit your input, use "\n" at the end of `content`.
- scroll(start_box='[x1, y1, x2, y2]', direction='down or up or right or left')
- wait() #Sleep for 5s and take a screenshot to check for any changes.
- finished(content='xxx') # Use escape characters \\', \\", and \\n in content part to ensure we can parse the content in normal python string format.

The format must be Action: ...


## Note
- Use {language} in `Thought` part.
- Write a small plan and finally summarize your next action (with its target element) in one sentence in `Thought` part.

## Examples
```
Thought: Since the page is still loading, it's necessary to wait for the content to fully render. This will ensure that the dog images are displayed, allowing me to proceed with selecting and saving a picture. Waiting is the logical next step to allow the browser to complete loading the image search results.

Action: wait()
```

```
Thought: To view dog pictures, I need to switch to the image search results. The (Images) tab is located below the search bar, among other category tabs. Clicking on this tab will display only image results for "dog pictures," which is necessary for selecting a picture to save locally.

Action: click(start_box='<bbox>151 208 151 208</bbox>')
```
